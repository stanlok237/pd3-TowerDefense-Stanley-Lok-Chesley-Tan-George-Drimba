pd3-TowerDefense-Stanley-Lok-Chesley-Tan-George-Drimba
==================================
<h1>Project Description</h1>
A dynamic tower defense game where the user must strategically place down walls in such a way as to impede the path of the enemy units who are trying to reach your base and destroy it.  On these walls, you can place towers to attack these enemies as they pass by.  
<h2>Group Members</h2>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<span>1. If you would like to test the project while it is in development and you have Processing installed, this project can be run by simply opening the Game.pde file in the PDE and selecting play.</span><br>
<b>OR:</b><br>
<span>1. You can also run the standalone application.</span>
<h2>What Works</h2>
Most, if not all, of the user interface is functional and the A* Search works.  
<h2>What Doesn't Work</h2>
There is an occasional bug when pressing play that has the incorrect aspect ratio or stays minimized instead of popping back up.  If that happens, just fullscreen it and continue on playing.

Due to time constraints, we do not have animated attack from turrets
